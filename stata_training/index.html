<h1>Stata training</h1>

<p>This "Stata guide" is intended to be a handy resource for you, and you can use it the way you want. It is divided in topic but it is not consequential, meaning you can jump from one chapter to another without any problems. </p>

<p>If you already have a knowledge of what Stata is, you can definitely skip the Stata basic part. I will try to cover from the very basic to the very advanced (as far as I know), but if you think I took something for granted, or something is not well explained shoot me a message! Feel free to copy and paste my code and send me an email at gaiagaudenzi9@gmail.com if you have problems working with the code! </p>


<h2> What is Stata? </h2>
<p>Nothing else than a statistic software to analyze your data! It is widely used (at least in Economics, which is the field where I come from) and it is very simple to use. You can browse through this training to have a sense of what you can do with it and get used to the language and terminology. </p>

<h2>Great resources to learn Stata online</h2>
<p>There is only one way to get proficient with Stata: to have PATIENCE. Practice is fundamental to become better and better, do not get discouraged if you are not able to achieve what you want at the beginning. Stata prizes people who have patience and practice with perseverance. Hopefully this training and my source code will help you navigating the immense world for Data Cleaning, Processing and Analysis with Stata and will make the whole learning path easier and funnier! In the meantime, I leave you with some sources to learn Stata online that were extremely useful for me:
