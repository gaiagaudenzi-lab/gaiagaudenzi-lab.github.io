title: Resources to learn Stata

<p>This is an unusual Stata training. It is divided in topic but it is not consequential, meaning you can jump from one chapter to another without any problems. If you already have a knowledge of what Stata is, you can definitely skip the Stata basic part. Feel free to copy and paste my code and send me an email at gaiagaudenzi9@gmail.com if you have problems working with the code! </p>

<h2> What is Stata? </h2>
<p>Nothing else than a statistic software to analyze your data! It is widely used (at least in Economics, which is the field where I come from) and it is very simple to use. You can browse through this training to have a sense of what you can do with it and get used to the language and terminology. </p>
